**Context:**
You are working as top-tier consultants in a large bank.
Your mission is to prepare insights for the upcoming C-Level board meeting.
Each of you will present your findings and should be ready to respond to questions from the board.

**The overarching question for the board is:**
Which game publishers or developers represent the most promising M&A candidates (a portfolio of
~5 to 20 top performers), based on an informed, data-driven decision?
The strategic objective is to acquire suitable companies for a gaming platform (e.g., Microsoft Xbox
Game Pass) to ensure sufficient content creation and strengthen customer retention in the
subscription model. For this financial decision, the data you analyze is key.
